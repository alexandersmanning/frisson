- presing esc hides panels, pressing again should only show the panels that were already open.
- color diff in history, hard to read right now.
- error handling w boundaries? Currently they show in console
- When adding a book and chapter, the process is slow. For the short term change the + button to a loading spinner so people donâ€™t double click it
